  <p>The Modern Technology (MT) Council is just one technology initiative among many in Massachusetts. 
  It is my intention and goal for the MT Council to work with all technology-related initiatives in the state. 
  The core philosophy of Modern Technology, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (founder of the Web) envisioned it, is "Open Standards," and I am calling on all technology leaders to move toward this same goal, starting with the technology leaders of Massachusetts.</p>
  <p>As collaboration efforts progress, we will announce other technology leaders who subscribe to the Modern Technology philosophy.</p>
