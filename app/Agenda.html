Dear Council, 

The CCB and iMedia have concluded that the positive economic impact of the Modern Technology Council model is significant. Your participation has become critical to the planning of the official launch and success. 

Our next Council meeting on August 21st has grown beyond the capacity of iMedia's space and therefore has been moved to the UMass Library.

The scope of the meeting has expanded and now requires three hours, as follows:

Modern Technology Council- Workshop Planning Meeting

10:00 am - 11:00 am: Debriefing on the November Modern Technology Council Model and Kickoff Conference Planning (see below)
11:00 am - 12:00 pm: Breakout Sessions (see below)
12:00 pm - 1:00 pm: Debriefing on Breakout Sessions

It is critical that you help us interpret the mission, objectives and rewards to the individual target audiences.

Based on our last couple of meetings, it is clear that we need to move in parallel paths:
1) meet the immediate need for developing the talent pool to support technology projects in the pipeline
2) developing the model/framework for the council: it's mission, it's membership, it's benefit to the "players" 

To that end, we have decided to hold a full day workshop, hosted by UMass Dartmouth, that can be broken down into two parts:
1) vision and overview of the Council
2) a series of working sessions

The proposed/draft for the working sessions has been designed to drill down on the roles, obstacles and critical success factors for various players in the Council Concept.  More specifically, the role and expectations of:
1) Secondary Educators 
2) Primary Educators
3) Technology Companies
4) Sm-med Biz/Municipalities
5) IEEE "Sr. Engineers" of the Council
6) Business Model(s)

In addition, there are also working sessions for: 
5) How the Modern Technology Council will work- Framework for Council membership/fees, Board of Directors, Mission (Educate, Research, Creating Growth opportunities & operational efficiencies for clients, Certification, etc)
6) Workforce development - curriculum design and schedule for sessions, criteria for program participates, creating a pool of instructors, utilizing the local IEEE

On August 21st, we need to define more specifically the objectives of working session and to identify facilitators for the working sessions.  This is a critical piece in planning the workshop, sending invites, and its ultimate success.  Your participation is very much needed in this planning step.  please confirm attendance as well as help spread the work to potential additional potential key players.

Thank you Sheila for drafting the summary today and CCB for hosting the meeting along with all your amazing support.
