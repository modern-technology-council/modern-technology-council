The mission of the Modern Technology (MT) Council is to bring Modern Technology to the forefront of local education, workforce, and business, and to promote the same Open Standards, philosophies, and culture that have revolutionized technology in the past decade. We will connect local educational institutions and their students to modern technologists and experienced engineers so they may contribute to projects supplied by the community and Council members. The result will be the production of top technologists from Massachusetts who remain in Massachusetts, and this will foster  greater growth in our technology economy.
